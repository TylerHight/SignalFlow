# Crypto Trading Bot Development Plan ðŸš€

This document outlines the development plan for building a **crypto trading services** with backtesting, live trading, and strategy management capabilities. The plan is divided into phases, milestones, and deliverables to ensure a structured and efficient development process.

---

## **Phase 1: Setup & Foundation**
**Timeline**: Week 1-2  
**Goal**: Establish the project structure, tools, and basic functionality.

### **Milestones**
- [x] **Project Setup**
    - [x] Initialize Git repository and project structure.
    - [x] Install core dependencies (`CCXT`, `pandas`, `Backtrader`, `TA-Lib`).
    - [x] Configure `.env` for API keys and `config.yaml` for settings.

- [ ] **Data Pipeline**
    - [ ] Build `data_handler.py` to fetch and store historical/live data via CCXT.
    - [ ] Add caching logic to minimize API calls.

- [ ] **Logging & Error Handling**
    - [ ] Implement `logger.py` for trade logs, errors, and performance metrics.

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Functional project skeleton.
- [ ] Scripts to fetch historical data.
- [ ] Basic logging system.

## **Phase 2: Core Trading Functionality**
**Timeline**: Week 3-5  
**Goal**: Build the core trading engine and backtesting framework.

### **Milestones**
- [ ] **Exchange Integration**
    - [ ] Complete `exchange.py` to connect to exchanges (e.g., Binance) via CCXT.
    - [ ] Implement order execution (market, limit, stop-loss).

- [ ] **Strategy System**
    - [ ] Create `base_strategy.py` with entry/exit logic template.
    - [ ] Develop a sample strategy (e.g., **Moving Average Crossover**).

- [ ] **Backtesting Engine**
    - [ ] Build `backtester.py` to simulate strategies on historical data.
    - [ ] Add performance metrics (ROI, Sharpe ratio, drawdown).

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Live trading and backtesting capabilities for 1-2 strategies.
- [ ] Basic performance reports.

---

## **Phase 3: Feature Expansion**
**Timeline**: Week 6-8  
**Goal**: Enhance functionality with advanced features.

### **Milestones**
- [ ] **Technical Indicators**
    - [ ] Add 10+ indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands) via `TA-Lib` and `pandas_ta`.
    - [ ] Allow custom indicator creation in `custom_indicators.py`.

- [ ] **Advanced Strategies**
    - [ ] Implement momentum, mean-reversion, and machine learning strategies.
    - [ ] Add multi-timeframe analysis.

- [ ] **Risk Management**
    - [ ] Integrate position sizing, stop-loss/take-profit, and portfolio balancing.

- [ ] **User Interface**
    - [ ] Build a dashboard using `Streamlit` or `Plotly Dash` for strategy monitoring.

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Library of indicators and strategies.
- [ ] Risk management module.
- [ ] Basic dashboard for monitoring.

## **Phase 4: Testing & Optimization**
**Timeline**: Week 9-10  
**Goal**: Ensure reliability and improve performance.

### **Milestones**
- [ ] **Unit/Integration Tests**
    - [ ] Write tests for strategies, data handling, and exchange integration.
    - [ ] Use `pytest` for automated testing.

- [ ] **Backtesting Validation**
    - [ ] Test strategies on 3+ years of historical data.
    - [ ] Optimize parameters with grid search or genetic algorithms.

- [ ] **Performance Optimization**
    - [ ] Speed up data processing with `NumPy` vectorization.
    - [ ] Parallelize backtesting jobs.

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Test suite covering 80%+ of the codebase.
- [ ] Validated strategies with robust performance metrics.

---

## **Phase 5: Deployment & Monitoring**
**Timeline**: Week 11-12  
**Goal**: Deploy the services and ensure 24/7 reliability.

### **Milestones**
- [ ] **Deployment**
    - [ ] Containerize the app with `Docker`.
    - [ ] Deploy to AWS EC2 or a Raspberry Pi.

- [ ] **Monitoring**
    - [ ] Set up alerts for API failures or strategy anomalies.
    - [ ] Use `Grafana` or `Prometheus` for real-time metrics.

- [ ] **Documentation**
    - [ ] Write user guides for strategy creation and deployment.

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Bot running live on a cloud/local server.
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard and alerts.

---

## **Phase 6: Maintenance & Future Work**
**Timeline**: Ongoing  
**Goal**: Iterate based on feedback and market changes.

### **Milestones**
- [ ] **Bug Fixes**
    - [ ] Address issues reported during live trading.

- [ ] **New Features**
    - [ ] Add support for decentralized exchanges (e.g., Uniswap).
    - [ ] Integrate sentiment analysis (news, social media).

- [ ] **Community Building**
    - [ ] Open-source the project on GitHub.
    - [ ] Publish tutorials on strategy development.

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Regular updates and feature releases.
- [ ] Active GitHub repository with contributors.

## **Risks & Mitigation**
- **Security Risks**:
    - Mitigation: Use encryption for API keys and enable 2FA on exchange accounts.
- **Market Risks**:
    - Mitigation: Start with paper trading and small capital allocations.
- **Technical Risks**:
    - Mitigation: Implement circuit breakers to halt trading during API failures.

---

## **Tools & Resources**
- **Backtesting**: `Backtrader`, `VectorBT`.
- **Data**: CCXT, Binance Historical Data.
- **Deployment**: Docker, AWS, Raspberry Pi.
